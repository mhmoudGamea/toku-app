# toku_app

A new Flutter project.

it's a very simple app but by this app i learn 

- how to use audioplayer package,  by reading it's documentation i learn what is the deference between (UrlSource, DeviceFileSource, AssetSource),
  dealing with (play, setVolume) methods provided by AudioPlayer() class

- practice on refactoring my code and make a reusable widgets.

- the deference between required & @required

- 2 new widgets IntrinsicHeight(prefer to use SizedBox or Container instead as documentation say), VerticalDivider
